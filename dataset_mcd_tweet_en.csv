.@McDonalds's Israel supporting Israeli soldiers? That's sparked a boycott in the Middle East, but what should you do.

Some people say boycott McDonald's, it's the right thing to do Others say, don't hurt the franchises, they're innocent too.

McDonald's Israel's support for Israeli soldiers has sparked a boycott in the Middle East.

Franchises in the region are distancing themselves from the franchise in Israel and some are even donating money to show their support for Gaza.

TikTok stars are calling for a boycott of McDonald's, but some question the logic of boycotting a brand that operates independently and provides jobs to thousands of people in the region.

Boycotting McDonald's:

Franchises in the Middle East are independent entities that have nothing to do with the franchise in Israel.

Boycotting McDonald's could hurt thousands of innocent people who work for the company in the Middle East.

Boycotting McDonald's could also have a negative impact on the economies of Middle Eastern countries.

What do you think?

Should people in the Middle East boycott McDonald's or support the franchises that are trying to help people in Gaza?

Make your choice.

But remember, there's no easy answer to this voice.","@arunchandrac5","https://twitter.com/arunchandrac5/status/1720807250632245743","1720807250632245743","1","0","0"
